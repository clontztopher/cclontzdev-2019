I come from a graphic design\n              and advertising background. In college, I was both the Design\n              Editor for the university newspaper and the Vice President of the\n              club lacrosse team. I still enjoy throwing the ball around,\n              although my knees can no longer take the beating of playing in\n              games. I have coached fifth-grade and kindergarten teams but now I\n              mostly focus on trying to learn functional programming and the\n              best way to model a database.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n);\n"]}
