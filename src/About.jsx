            <p>
              I'm a self-taught developer currently residing in Austin, Texas.
              I've had many vocations and interests over the years but have
              found an ever-deepening curiousity and desire to learn code.
              Specifically, the theories and processes involved in creating
              well-architected and efficient applications, and the different
              paradigms and thought schools surrounding them, have been very
              intriguing and interesting to learn about and try to understand.

              In my spare time I binge watch my favorite episodes, ride my bike
              around town and hike the green belts. I come from a graphic design
              and advertising background. In college, I was both the Design
              Editor for the university newspaper and the Vice President of the
              club lacrosse team. I still enjoy throwing the ball around,
              although my knees can no longer take the beating of playing in
              games. I have coached fifth-grade and kindergarten teams but now I
              mostly focus on trying to learn functional programming and the
              best way to model a database.
